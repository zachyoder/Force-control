# Force-control
Program which interfaces with a high-voltage amplifier and a dual-mode muscle lever via a NI DAQ.
The program is .mlapp file type, meant for running and editing in MATLAB's app designer.
To track changes in Git, the .mlapp file must be exported as a .m file - .changes to .mlapp files cannot be viewed in Git.
Both the .mlapp and .m files should be committed.
